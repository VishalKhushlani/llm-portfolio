# LLM Portfolio: Summarisation & Brochure Generation 🚀

This is an evolving portfolio of hands-on LLM projects. It documents my learning journey through building real-world applications using tools like OpenAI API, Ollama, and Hugging Face. The focus is on practical skills development, starting with two initial projects: text summarisation and automatic brochure generation from company websites.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone this Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VishalKhushlani/llm-portfolio
cd llm-portfolio
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

You can use `conda`:
```bash
conda create -n llm-env python=3.10
conda activate llm-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or `pip` directly:
```bash
python -m venv llm-env
source llm-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `llm-env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Environment Variable

To use OpenAI's API, set the following environment variable in a `.env` file or directly in your shell:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

> You can obtain an API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
